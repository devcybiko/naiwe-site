Here are some things she shared.\r\n\r\n<em>What is one thing that you learned about your craft the hard way, and what benefits have you received from it? Can these benefits be broadened to include marketing?</em>\r\n\r\nAs a digital journalist, making connections was the hardest part. Finding editors to assign regular work can be so difficult because they move around so much. You have to keep putting yourself out there and continuously making new business relationships. The benefit is that you can write for a great publication, work with an editor who keeps you in mind throughout their career, secure references, and find a regular feed of work or a home for regular pitches. Those benefits can help you market yourself as a journalist and build your platform.\r\n\r\n<em>What has been your most rewarding marketing avenue, and how was it rewarding? Self? Monetary? Clients?</em>\r\n\r\nLetters of introduction. The direct connection you get from sending an email can be quite helpful in establishing a relationship--especially in the digital world.\r\n\r\n<em>What do you associate with marketing?</em>\r\n\r\nCreativity. Even if you\'re not working in the marketing field, writers are creative people. Also, they have to find creative ways to market themselves. I hope more freelance journalists realize that staying in business for themselves isn\'t so much about the writing; it\'s about running your business. And staying in business demands marketing.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nWhether you write for digital or print avenues, being a freelance journalist can be tough. This webinar will explore how to target publications, how to secure editorial contacts, how to line up regular work, and how to overcome obstacles that arise when you’re not on staff. Participants will learn business tips to break into new publications as a freelancer and keep a steady flow of freelance work coming. Bring a list of questions and your best tip for securing work as a freelance journalist.\r\n\r\nYou can join in this conversation on August 22, at 3 pm eastern, when NAIWE will host a discussion on marketing as a freelance journalist.\r\n\r\nThe cost for NAIWE members is only $10!

Thaler-Carter</em>\r\n\r\nInspired by a colleague’s request to write about birthdays, I came up with a few thoughts. Here I am in my 60s, and not quite sure what it means — but not worried about it.\r\n\r\nSupposedly I’m old — but I don’t feel old. Of course, it helps that I seem to still be mentally intact and involved, can still look after myself, continue to be able to do the work I love. I think it also helps that I have a marvelous network of long-time friends who keep me feeling young, perhaps because we keep our wacky childhood and high school memories so fresh by staying close and seeing, or at least communicating with, each other fairly often.\r\n\r\nEven if I did feel old, why would that be a bad thing? I’ve survived more than just the passing of the years, but a wide range of crises over those years, and that’s something to be proud of. It’s why I don’t let myself be pressured into coloring my hair when I go to the salon for haircuts (well, other than a splash of purple!): I earned every gray or white hair, and see no need to cover them up.\r\n\r\nI know how I got here: born, raised, lived; still living. That’s a good thing. As my mom used to say whenever someone complained about the infelicities and challenges of increasing age, “Consider the alternative.”\r\n\r\nSome aspects of all these birthdays <em>are</em> a nuisance — my knees and hips have started to creak a bit and make it difficult to get up from a chair or the bed, and to negotiate stairs, but … consider the alternative.\r\n\r\nGetting older does mean dealing with loss. Both of my parents have died, and I miss them constantly, but … I had my dad in my life for more than 40 years and my mom for 60; that’s a lot longer than many friends can claim, and those were all wonderful, loving, supportive, fun years — also more and better than many people experience. And it’s natural for parents to go before their children. When life takes the opposite direction, it’s unimaginable.\r\n\r\nMy beloved husband, who was 12 years older than me, died last year and I miss him every moment of every day, but … we had 30 delightful years together, which is —again — more than many people get from their relationships and marriages. He was a tough guy (a retired steelworker; my man of steel!) who accepted the limits of aging with surprising grace; rather than complain (“Consider the alternative!”) or give up, he focused on what he still could do. His attitude toward birthdays, aging and increasing fragility was admirable: “I can’t do what I used to, but I’ll find a way to do as much as possible. If I can’t walk on my own, I’ll use a walker so I can still get around and go places. If I can’t carry all my cameras, lenses and gear, I’ll switch to digital. If I have dietary issues, I’ll reconfigure my favorite recipes so I can still enjoy some of the things I love to eat ...”\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that increasing age probably will mean decreasing physical ability, I made a huge life change last year. What started out as thinking about moving locally to a neighborhood that would be more walkable and accessible turned into moving halfway across the country and becoming a first-time homeowner at this ripe age! While my new place — a condo — doesn’t have the front desk and onsite staff of the building I left, it is right across the street from a beautiful park and within two to five blocks of everything from shops to restaurants to a library branch, small concert venue, bookstore, medical center and more. I’m prepared for pretty much anything; I even have a dedicated guest room in case I ever need live-in care, instead of hving to use a second bedroom as my workspace.\r\n\r\nBeing “old” has its advantages. I qualify for Medicare, so I save a bundle on medical insurance, and can start getting my Social Security benefits whenever I’m ready to stop working (if that ever happens; I do find retirement hard to envision, but that’s because I enjoy what I do, and not — mainly thanks to my financial genius of a mom — because I have to keep working). And I get a kick out of senior discounts, even though I don’t see myself as “senior.” My recollection, although my brothers disagree, is that my dad loved using his 60-plus discounts; he said he earned and deserved them, and I concur.\r\n\r\nI see every birthday as a type of new year, so I have more than January 1 as a moment to reflect, refresh and sometimes revamp. A birthday is an opportunity to celebrate still being here and to think about what new things I might do to stay as sharp, engaged and active as possible, both physically and mentally; socially and professionally; intellectually and maybe even emotionally. This year, I decided that my birthday present to myself would to be more creative and expand my interests beyond activities related to my work life. I’ve started playing around with painting and glasswork — neither of which I do very well (yet), but who knows where these might go! — and am looking into going back to a long-ago hobby of ceramics.\r\n\r\nThese projects are birthday gifts to myself that I think will take me into increasing age with increasing creativity and continuing mental and physical agility, a sense of joy and achievement, and appreciation for survival on many levels. They are my ways of fulfilling the concept of “I’m not (just) getting older; I’m getting better.” As actress Renée Zellweger told AARP’s <em>Modern Maturity</em> magazine (yup, I’m an AARP member) recently, “… I don’t call it aging; I call it winning.” I try to embrace getting older and having more birthdays. After all, “consider the alternative.”\r\n\r\nHere’s to happy birthdays for all of us, and graceful, grateful perspectives on getting older!\r\n\r\n<em>Ruth E.

Here are some thoughts she shared with us.\r\n\r\n<em>What is one thing that you learned about your craft the hard way, and what benefits have you received from it? Can these benefits be broadened to include book promotions?</em>\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to recognize for one’s craft is that of identifying the target audience, as a book is not written for everyone. It must have a specific audience in mind. Genres, of course, are there to assist readers in locating books that they like. Often, there are specific tropes that are used in the genre.\r\n\r\nFor example, romance requires a happy for now or happily-ever-after ending. If it does not meet that standard, then it cannot be classified as a romance. If it is advertised as a romance, and the genre tropes and requirements are something to keep in mind when it comes to crafting a novel, as well as the later marketing of it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>What has been your most rewarding book promotions avenue, and how was it rewarding? Self? Monetary? Clients?</em>\r\n\r\nI believe that the best thing an author can do is grow their newsletter, and that growth is from where most of my success continues to come.\r\n\r\nIt is through my newsletter that I can create relationships with my readers, who frequently will then share news of my books with their circle of friends. All other promotion has its uses, but for long-term growth, the newsletter is the best way to continue to grow.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>What do you associate with book promotions?</em>\r\n\r\nBook promotion is when the goal is to promote or make an audience aware of a particular book. This can include, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>paid ads (like Facebook, Amazon and BookBub ads)</li>\r\n 	<li>paid newsletter ads (these are ads in book newsletters. Note, some are genre-specific, while others are not)</li>\r\n 	<li>newsletter swaps (when authors share the news of a different author’s book to their audience)</li>\r\n 	<li>free or cost-efficient promo (posting in Facebook groups, blogging, guest blogging, multi-author book fairs, tweeting, using social media to push the book without paying, creating a perma-free book to drive sales to other books in a series, creating a lead magnet to get new readers to sign up for your newsletter, etc.).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nPaying for expensive book promotion only makes sense if one has more than one book in a series, or other books available that a reader can purchase. Book promotion is to advertise and to make readers aware of a product. It is best to use cheaper options, all within one’s author budget before one launches the more advanced ad campaigns.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nAre you struggling with what you can do to make your books a success?

Here are some thoughts she shared with us.\r\n\r\n<em>What is one thing that you learned about your craft the hard way, and what benefits have you received from it? Can these benefits be broadened to include book promotions?</em>\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to recognize for one’s craft is that of identifying the target audience, as a book is not written for everyone. It must have a specific audience in mind. Genres, of course, are there to assist readers in locating books that they like. Often, there are specific tropes that are used in the genre.\r\n\r\nFor example, romance requires a happy for now or happily-ever-after ending. If it does not meet that standard, then it cannot be classified as a romance. If it is advertised as a romance, and the genre tropes and requirements are something to keep in mind when it comes to crafting a novel, as well as the later marketing of it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>What has been your most rewarding book promotions avenue, and how was it rewarding? Self? Monetary? Clients?</em>\r\n\r\nI believe that the best thing an author can do is grow their newsletter, and that growth is from where most of my success continues to come.\r\n\r\nIt is through my newsletter that I can create relationships with my readers, who frequently will then share news of my books with their circle of friends. All other promotion has its uses, but for long-term growth, the newsletter is the best way to continue to grow.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>What do you associate with book promotions?</em>\r\n\r\nBook promotion is when the goal is to promote or make an audience aware of a particular book. This can include, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>paid ads (like Facebook, Amazon and BookBub ads)</li>\r\n 	<li>paid newsletter ads (these are ads in book newsletters. Note, some are genre-specific, while others are not)</li>\r\n 	<li>newsletter swaps (when authors share the news of a different author’s book to their audience)</li>\r\n 	<li>free or cost-efficient promo (posting in Facebook groups, blogging, guest blogging, multi-author book fairs, tweeting, using social media to push the book without paying, creating a perma-free book to drive sales to other books in a series, creating a lead magnet to get new readers to sign up for your newsletter, etc.).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nPaying for expensive book promotion only makes sense if one has more than one book in a series, or other books available that a reader can purchase. Book promotion is to advertise and to make readers aware of a product. It is best to use cheaper options, all within one’s author budget before one launches the more advanced ad campaigns.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nAre you struggling with what you can do to make your books a success?
